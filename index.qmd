# Ivan Anokhin

_PhD student at **Mila / UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al** working on streaming RL, asynchronous credit assignment, and longâ€‘term memory._

Welcome! I build reinforcementâ€‘learning systems that learn while acting under tight compute and memory constraints. I'm especially interested in designs that keep perception, action, and adaptation proceeding together, and in mechanisms for compact, selective longâ€‘term memory.

- **Research:** streaming/online RL, asynchronous computation, credit assignment, longâ€‘term memory
- **Interests:** biologically inspired learning, LLM reasoning + RL, efficient onâ€‘device learning
