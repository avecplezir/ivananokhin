# Ivan Anokhin

_PhD student at **Mila / Université de Montréal**._

I’m a PhD student at Mila / Université de Montréal, broadly interested in scalable and generalizable reinforcement learning advised by [Irina Rish](https://sites.google.com/view/irinarish/). 
Before that, I was lucky to work with [Victor Lempitsky](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gYYVokYAAAAJ&hl=en) at Samsung AI Center and [Dmitry Yarotsky](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wNSSr_gAAAAJ&hl=en) at Skoltech; I also worked at Yandex and earned a BSc from Saint Petersburg State University.
